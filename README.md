OpenCV 3
Python 2.7

Code
Part 1.
1. Face Detection in a single image using Haar Cascade Classifier
2. Smiling Face Detection  in a single image using Haar Cascade Classifier
3. Face Detection in your webcam using Haar Cascade Classifier
4. Human Detection in a video using Haar Cascade Classifier
5. Face Detection in a single image using LBP Cascade Classifier

Part 2. Object Classification and Detection
1. Classify ships/no-ship using HOG features and SVM classifier (ipython)
2. Detect and classify handwritten digits 
3. Use a pre-trained multi-scale SVM classifier to detect people using HOG features
4. Train our own model to detect cars using HOG features with Bag-of-word and SVM
